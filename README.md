The Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) UI is an admin dashboard designed to manage users, roles, and permissions within an application. The purpose of this project is to provide a secure, user-friendly interface for administrators to efficiently handle user accounts, define roles, assign permissions, and maintain security by controlling access to different parts of the system based on user roles.

The application includes:

User Management: Admins can view, create, edit, and delete users, as well as assign them specific roles and monitor their activity status. Role Management: Admins can define, modify, and delete roles. Each role can have associated permissions, such as "Read", "Write", or "Delete", which determine the level of access to various resources. Permission Management: Permissions can be assigned or modified for each role, allowing for flexible and granular control over what actions users in each role can perform within the system. Responsive Design: The dashboard is designed to be responsive, ensuring usability across both desktop and mobile devices. Dark Mode: A toggleable dark mode option is provided for user preference.

I played a pivotal role in the design and implementation of the RBAC UI by:

Defining the UI/UX Components:

I contributed to the design of the dashboard layout, sidebars, and modals. I ensured that the interface was user-friendly, with clear calls-to-action for user and role management. I ensured the design was responsive, allowing it to function seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices. Developing Role and Permission Management:

I designed and implemented the Add/Edit Role Modal where administrators can define roles and assign specific permissions. This includes checkboxes for permissions such as "Read", "Write", "Delete", and "Execute". I developed the functionality for dynamic role and permission assignment, ensuring that roles could be easily modified by selecting or deselecting permissions, with changes reflected immediately in the UI. User Management Features:

I implemented features that allow admins to add, edit, and delete users, while also managing their roles and statuses (Active/Inactive). Users can be associated with roles, which control their permissions and access to different sections of the application. Adding Dark Mode Support:

I implemented a dark mode toggle, allowing administrators to switch between light and dark themes. This helps improve the overall user experience, especially for prolonged usage. The dark mode preference is stored in local storage, ensuring the theme persists between sessions. Creating Role-Based Permission System:

I worked on developing a robust system for assigning permissions to roles. Admins can modify a role's permissions dynamically through the UI, either when creating new roles or editing existing ones. This permission system ensures that access to sensitive data or actions is restricted based on the assigned role of a user. Enhancing the UI Responsiveness and Interactivity:

I ensured that the sidebar was collapsible and mobile-responsive, allowing administrators to easily toggle the sidebar in smaller screen sizes. I focused on making the modals for adding/editing users and roles mobile-friendly, ensuring they are visually appealing and function well on mobile devices. Simulating CRUD Operations:

While the system does not include a back-end API, I simulated CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) on users and roles using JavaScript arrays to store the data. This mimics the server-side data operations and provides a real-time interactive experience for the user. User-Centric Design:

Throughout the development process, I prioritized user experience (UX) by providing intuitive navigation, clear instructions, and user feedback (e.g., form validations, success messages). I ensured that each action, whether adding a user, modifying a role, or changing permissions, was simple and clear for the administrator.
